# `useSignOut` hook

`useSignOut` hook is used to sign out currently signed-in user. A very simple example would be:

```typescript
const { dispatch } = useSignOut({ auth });
await dispatch();
```

!!! warning
    `useSignOut` is lazy by default and will not do anything until you use `dispatch` function.

You can also get the state of sign-out process.

```typescript
const { state, dispatch } = useSignOut({ auth });
await dispatch();
// `state` is "ready" | "loading" | "done"
```

!!! warning
    `useSignOut` hook does not listen to current authentication state. Refer to [`useUser` hook](./useUser-hook.md) to reflect changes on authentication state changes.
