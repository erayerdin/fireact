# `useUploadFile` Hook

`useUploadFile` hook is used to upload a file to Firebase Storage. A very simple example would be:

```typescript
const reference = ref(storage, "path/to/remote/file.png");
const { dispatch } = useUploadFile({ reference });
const result = await dispatch(file);
```

`dispatch` method will return an instance of [`UploadResult`][UploadResultRefDoc].

!!! warning
    `useUploadFile` is lazy by default and will not do anything until you use `dispatch` function.

```typescript
const { state } = useUploadFile({ reference });
await dispatch();
// `state` is "ready" | [number, number] | "done"
```

Unlike other hooks, `useUploadFile` does not have a `"loading"` state. Instead, it will have `[number, number]` state. The first element represents the transferred bytes while the last one represents the total bytes, so you can use these to reflect it on a kind of progressbar.

If you do not want to use a progressbar but use a spinner-like interface to keep it simple, you can get `"loading"` state as such:

```typescript
const isUploading = typeof state === "array";
// will be true if uploading
// will be false if not
```
